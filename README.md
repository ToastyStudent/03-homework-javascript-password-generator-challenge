# 03-Homework-Javascript-Password-Generator-Challenge

## Description
This project was built from starter code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp, with me writing code, using Javascript, to create a Password Generator on a pre-made HTML page.

Specifically, I utilized Javascript elmenents, particularly a for loop; several arrays; prompts; and if statements, to create the aformentioned generator.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed github pages page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. Said interaction/usage would involve generating a password by following the prompts the web page provides. Additionally, you can view the password being built by looking in their browswer's console to see logged code.
